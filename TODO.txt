media queries
- Add calc function, ie:

buttons
- remove side margin. let user decide which side to put it on using @chassis apply

@chassis viewport-width < calc(medium + 200px)

^ This should get the value of medium and add 200px to it. It should
ideally be able to calculate different units as well, if possible.

New Features
--------------------
- Add eval() function for math preprocessing
- Add vars for things like "button-box-model" so that display properties can be
  reset automatically


chassis-select
- Add focus
- "label" attribute should override innerHTML as this is
  the default <select> behavior
- Missing HTMLSelectElement methods:
  - .add()
  - .item()
  - .namedItem()
  - .remove()
- Complete arrow key functions

Spec Sheets still don't fully support nesting
Theme doesn't support mixins

Spec sheet states can't have more than one selector. ie:

component {
  @state disabled {
    $(selector)[disabled] {
      opacity: .382;
    }

    $(selector)[disabled="false"] {
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
}

If a theme or extension calls for this:

extension {
  @chassis extend component {
    @state disabled {
      background: red;
    }
  }
}

...where does the background: red decl go?

Possible solution: Always add extension decls to the first rule in
each state. That should theoretically work in all cases.
