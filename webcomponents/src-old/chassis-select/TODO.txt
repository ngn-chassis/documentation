Add a "highlighted" state to option that is different from selected or hovered.
This state could be used to alter the styling of options which are highlighted
by keyboard commands, but are not hovered or having their selection state altered.

Add an attribute when the options panel is scrolled. This could allow for adding
inset box shadows on the top or bottom of the panel to indicate which direction
it has been scrolled.
